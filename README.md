<p align="center"> An artifitial intelligence algorithm program to trade classes between students </p>

## Overview 

In the university the students are allowed to choose the classes they want to attend in certain subject. For example, the Programming subject many schedules that can be 
chosen, however, not everyone can get the class that happens at 2PM.   

Currently, a student at FEUP can only change his classes if him find another person that also wants to change the class with him.   
To automatize this process, NIAEFEUP has created the subject-trade: an algorithm that, once inputed with information of students that wants to change the classes, finds 
the best trading configuration.
